    <main>Born and raised in New Jersey, Cindy began her design journey at Barnard College while pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in psychology. Her first formal coding experience was through the Athena Digital Design Agency where
      she learned HTML and CSS in which she produced this personal website. She is bilingual in Spanish and English. Some of her work includes redesinging Columbia Daily Spectator multimedia page, creating a new website for the housing process, and app
      development. In her free time, Cindy enjoys photography, learning new languages (coding or not), and lifting.</main>

      <h1> Tech + Me </h1>
      <h2> Tech has been a part of my life over the past four years non traditionally. At the start of this journey I used free online programs to practice coding skills like Javascript and the first code I looked at was HTML and CSS on Tumblr for
        themes.
        My first few experiences in this new world began with global and local competitions like Technovation and YouthCITIES in Cambridge, MA.
        Both of these programs gave access to students like myself who can't afford high tech equipment or are underrepresented within their communities. A few years later I became director of a club called Abbot Research Innovation Science and
        Engineering in which our mission was to provide access in STEM fields by exposure to programs, local tech competitions, and our own science research conference.
        Next semester I plan on taking a traditional academic intro to java or python class. Since technology continues to shape our worlds, it is important to consider who is in the room designing and creating products for what audiences.
